          <p>
            Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. <br>
            Washing hands can keep you healthy and prevent the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections from one person to the next.<br>
            Wash your hands with soap and running water when hands are visibly dirty if your hands are not visibly dirty,frequently clean them by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.

          <h1>Wear a Mask</h1>
          <p>
            Wearing a mask is one of the essential measures to stop transmission and save lives. The mask decreases the potential risk of exposure of an infected person, whether or not they have symptoms. People who wear a mask are protected from infection. The mask also prevents the transmission of infection when worn by an infected person.<br>

          <h1>Respect Physical Distancing</h1>
          <p>
            Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. <br>
this means we keep a distance of at least 1m from each other and avoid spending time in crowded places or in groups.</p>

          <p>
           Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.<br>
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer .
