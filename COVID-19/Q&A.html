  	  	  <div class="card-body">
            <p>Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.<br>
              Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care provider’s recommendation. </p>

  	  	  </div>
  	  	  <div class="card-body">
            <p>Quarantine means restricting activities or separating people who are not ill themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19. The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms.<br>
              Isolation means separating people who are ill with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be infectious to prevent the spread of the disease.<br>
              Physical distancing means being physically apart. WHO recommends keeping at least 1-metre distance from others. This is a general measure that everyone should take even if they are well with no known exposure to COVID-19.<br> </p>

  	  	  <div class="card-body">
            <p>COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever or tiredness. Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true in the early stages of the disease. It is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has just a mild cough and does not feel ill.<br>
              Some reports have indicated that people with no symptoms can transmit the virus. It is not yet known how often it happens.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <p>if you have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home. If you think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider.</p>

       <span class="fa fa-plus"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
        <li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.</li>
        <li>Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre.</li>
        <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.</li>
        <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
      </ul>

     <h3>Should I be tested for a current infection? </h3>
     <span class="fa fa-plus"></span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.<br>
      If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.<br>
      CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments and healthcare providers.<br>
      You can also visit your state or local health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing.</p>

     <h3>Am I at risk if i go to a funeral service for someone who died<br> of COVID-19? </h3>
     <span class="fa fa-plus"></span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19. However, you may be at risk of getting COVID-19 if you attend a funeral where there are multiple people congregating. For more information about what you can do to help protect yourself and others from COVID-19 during these services, and to help cope with the loss of a loved one, see Funeral Guidance.</p>

     <h3>What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?</h3>
     <span class="fa fa-plus"></span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children with certain underlying medical conditions and infants (less than 1 year old) might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).</p>

     <h3>Can COVID-19 spread through food</h3>
     <span class="fa fa-plus"></span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>It is highly unlikely that people can contract COVID-19 from food or food packaging. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the primary transmission route is through person-to- person contact and through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.<br>
      There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply.</p>

     <h3>What areas should be prioritized for disinfection in non <br> health care settings?</h3>
     <span class="fa fa-plus"></span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Disinfection practices are important to reduce the potential for COVID-19 virus contamination in non-healthcare settings, such as in the home, office, schools, gyms, publicly accessible buildings, faith-based community centres, markets, transportation and business settings or restaurants. High-touch surfaces in these non-health care settings should be identified for priority disinfection such as door and window handles, kitchen and food preparation areas, counter tops, bathroom surfaces, toilets and taps, touchscreen personal devices, personal computer keyboards, and work surfaces.</p>
